# AI-Challenge-Solution

## Challenge 
A telecom network consisting of multiple nodes. These nodes are network devices which are subject to issues affecting their performance. The issues range from overheating, unavailability of service, quality of service degradation, traffic congestion â€¦etc. In our case we have 13 different issues. Each node generates reports about its performance through what is called counters (sensors).

AModel is a machine learning classifier that classifies the issues by each node. Design and implement a black box adversarial attack on AModel.

## Given Dataset
The dataset is not shared as requested. There are two files: one is the input for the AModel and the other is the ouput of the AModel.
